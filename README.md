# OpenCitationsCharts
Repository for the web application that displays statistics about the OpenCitations dataset

The project is currently WIP. The parsing functions and the web app have been developed by using a rather small portion of the COCI dataset (i.e. file "020-04-25T04:48:36_1.csv"). 
The Crossref dataset has been cleaned to optmize the seach process. You can find more information about this on the notebooks that have run on Google Colab to process the data.
